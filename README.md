# Arduino-LED-Circle
Various patterns displayed on an array of 24 LEDs arranged in a circle.
Pattern selection, speed and direction are controlled by 2 potentiometers and a shift switch.
LEDs are wired to an Arduino through three 74HC595N Shift Registers, 8 LEDs per chip.
Code for accessing individual LEDs connected to shift registers came from here: http://bildr.org/2011/02/74hc595/
